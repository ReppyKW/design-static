        <h4>Bio</h4>
        <div class="paragraph-wrap">
          <p>I was raised in a close knit family in London, Ontario. My father was a salesman and my mother was a teacher. The highlight of my childhood was always our annual fishing trips. It's something I try to do with my children as often as possible.</p>

          <p>After graduating from the University of Guelph in commerce I decided to become a real estate agent. I had worked in real estate part time before and knew that being an agent is one of the most satisfying jobs one could think of. There's no feeling like finding your client the perfect home.</p>

          <p>I pride myself on my strong work ethics and commitment. For me the home buying and selling process should never be rushed. The perfect home for you does exist. It is just a matter of putting the time and effort into finding it.</p>

          <p>When I'm not working I'm usually taking my kids to their sports practices or coaching their soccer team. You might also find me having picnics by the canal! Don't feel shy to get in touch, I love meeting new clients and making new friends.</p>
